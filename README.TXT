This is a (mostly) functional computer built solely using NAND gates with Java. 

Three assembly programs are already written for testing. "program1.txt" is a simple counting program, it will print numbers from 1 to 65,535 if you let it run long enough. "program2.txt" prints powers of 2, starting from 1. "program3.txt" prints the fibonacci numbers.

To run, simply initialize the AssemblerLanguage class and call `.run("fileName.txt")`

A huge thanks to Olav Junker Kj√¶r for creating https://nandgame.com, which I used to learn the computer architecure content I needed to build this.
